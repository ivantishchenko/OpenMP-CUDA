OK!
Note: adding the binaries (e.g. *.o and mf files) to the repository is unnecessary.
Hint: You can speedup the solution by not allocating a new window_elements vector in the inner loop but recycling the same one (i.e., allocate it before the inner loop and just clear it every time when the loop starts).
